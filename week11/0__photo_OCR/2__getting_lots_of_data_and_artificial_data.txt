How to get lots of data?
    - artificial data synthesis
        + generating random data from scratch
        + add distortion to preexisting data
            * pure random is usually not a great idea
            * try generating distortion that mimic real life
    - discussion on getting mode data
        1- always make sure you need more data
            * use learning curve (Jtrain, Jcv)
        2- how much work would it be to get 10x as much data as we currently have?
            * artificial data synthesis
            * collect/label it yourself
            * crowd source  (Amazon Mechanical Turk)

Example: OCR
    - generating random data from scratch:
        1- put random back ground in each frame
        2- chose a font
        3- put chars in each frame
    - add distortion to preexisting data:
        - warp char
        - add noise
        - etc

Example: speech recognition
    - add distortion to preexisting data:
        - bad cellphone connection
        - noisy background: crowd
        - noisy background: machinery
