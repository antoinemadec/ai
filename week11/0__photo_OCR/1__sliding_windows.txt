Sliding window example: pedestrian detection
    - agree on ratio: 82x36
    - feed the NN on sliding windows of 82x36 in the image
        + choose a step-size/stride
    - do the same with larger window
        + instead of bigger window, use smaller image

Pipeline:
    1- text detection
        a- use a 2D sliding window
        b- use expansion algorithm to connect all the letters and have rectangles
        c- check aspect ration of rectangles who seem OK
    2- character segmentation
        use a 1D sliding window on the rectangle
            y=1 when window in between 2 letters
        output x coord of separation in the rectangle
    3- character classification
        use NN
