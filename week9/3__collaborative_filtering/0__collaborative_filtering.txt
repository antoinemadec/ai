Problem Motivation:
    - users tell us that they like romantic or action movie
        they give us their theta
    - try to guess the features (x1,x2) of each movie based on:
        + users' theta
        + users' rating (when define)

Optimization Algorithm:
    to learn x(i), try to minimize:
        1/2 * sum((theta(j)T*x(i)-y(i,j))^2) + lambda/2 * sum(x(i)^2)
    principle:
        guess theta from x, guess x from theta, guess theta from x, etc
