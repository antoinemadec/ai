Learning rate:
    - gradient descent:
        + tj = tj - alpha*dJ(t)/dtj
        + how to make sure to get the right alpha?
    - number of iteration depends on application

Choosing the right alpha:
    - alpha is OK:
        + automatic convergence test:
            * convergence if J(t) decreases by less than 10^-3
    - alpha is not OK:
        + J(t) increases:
            * use a smaller alpha
        + J(t) does bumps:
            * use a smaller alpha
    - concretely:
        + try:
            alpha = 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1
