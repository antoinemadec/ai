Example:
    - use linear regression:
        + h(x) = t0 + t1*frontage + t2*depth
            * where:
                x1 = frontage
                x2 = depth
    - or change the features:
        + h(x) = t0 + t1*size = t0 + t1*(frontage*depth)
    - or use polynomial regression:
        + h(x) = t0 + t1.x + t2.x^2 + t3.x^3
            * where:
                x = size
        + can be mapped to a linear regression with:
            x1 = size
            x2 = size^2
            x3 = size^3

How to choose which model to choose?
    - use an algorithm
