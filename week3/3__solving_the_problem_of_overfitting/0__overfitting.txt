What is overfitting:
    - underfit:
        + when model does not follow training example
        + the model has a "high bias"
    - overfitting:
        + a complex model is created to exactly match the training example
        + the model has "high variance"
    - problem: model too complex to match accurately the training set will make poor prediction on unseen examples

Addressing overfitting:
    - plotting:
        + works when not a lot of features
        + does not scale (e.g.: n=100)
    - options:
        1- reduce number of features
            * manually select which features to keep
            * model selection algorithm
        2- regularization
            * keep all the features, but reduce magnitude values of parameters tj
            * works well when we have a lot of features, each of which contributes a bit to predicting y
