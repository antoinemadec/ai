Logistic Regression Model:
    - want 0 <= h(x) <= 1
    - linear regression representation:
        + h(x) = tT*x
    - logistic regression representation:
        + h(x) = g(tT*x)
            * g(z) = 1/(1+e(-z))
        + h(x) = 1/(1+e(-tT*x))
        + logistic function = sigmoid function
        + the goal is still to minimize the error over theta

Interpretation of hypothesis output:
    - h(x) = estimated probability that y=1 on input x
        + h(x) = 0.7 : 70% chance of malignant tumor
        + h(x) = P(y=1|x; t)
