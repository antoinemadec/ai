Learning with large Datasets:
    - let's say we have m = 100,000,000
    - gradient descent:
        tj := tj - alpha/m * sum((h(x(i))-y(i))*xj(i))
            that is computationally intensive!!!
    - use 1000 examples to see if a bigger dataset is needed
        datasets needed with high variance systems
            look at the learning curve (Jtrain,Jcv) = f(m)
