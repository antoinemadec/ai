SVM = large margin optimization:
    we try to minimize
        C*sum(y(i)*cost1(tT*x(i)) + (1-y(i))*cost0(tT*x(i)) + 1/2*sum(tj^2)
    if y = 1, we want tT*x >= 1
    if y = 0, we want tT*x <= -1

SVM Decision Boundary:
    - it is more "in the middle" than logistic regression
    - if C not too large, it discards outliers well
