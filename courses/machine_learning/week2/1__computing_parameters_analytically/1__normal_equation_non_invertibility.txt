Recap:
    - theta formula to minimize cost function:
        t = (XT*X)^-1 * XT*y
        + in octave:
            pinv(X'*X)*X'*y

What if XT*X is non-invertible?
    - pinv in Octave, will work (pseudo-inv)
    - causes:
        + redundant features - linearly dependent:
            * e.g.:
                x1 = size in feet2
                x2 = size in m2
        + too many features:
            * e.g.:
                m <= n
            * solution:
                ~ delete some features
                ~ use regularization
