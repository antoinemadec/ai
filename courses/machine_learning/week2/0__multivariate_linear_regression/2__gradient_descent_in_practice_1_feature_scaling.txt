Feature Scaling:
    - idea:
        make sure features are on a similar scale,
        otherwise, converging to minimum might take a long time
    - implementation:
        get every feature into approximately:
            -1 <= xi <= 1

Mean Normalization:
    - idea:
        replace xi (except for x0) with:
            (xi - mean(xi)) / (max(xi)-min(xi))
    - implementation:
        x1 = (size - 1000)/2000
        x2 = (#bedrooms - 2)/5
        -0.5<=xj<=0.5
