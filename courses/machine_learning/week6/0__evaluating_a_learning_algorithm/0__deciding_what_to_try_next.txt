Deciding which route to take:
    - example:
        + predicting housing price
        + regularized linear regression
        + what if error is huge on new set of houses:
            * get more training examples
            * try smaller sets of features
            * try getting additional features
            * try adding polynomial features
            * try decreasing lambda (regularization factor)
            * try increasing lambda (regularization factor)
        + machine learning diagnostic:
            * test that you can run to gain insight on what is/isn't working
            with a learning algorithm, and gain guidance as to how best to
            improve its performance
