We want to predict y=1 only if very confident:
    - predict 1 if h(x) >= 0.9; 0 otherwise
    - higher precision, lower recall

We want to avoid missing too many cases of cancer:
    - predict 1 if h(x) >= 0.3; 0 otherwise
    - lower precision, higher recall

Score:
    - how to choose which (P,R) couple is the best?
        + average: not good
        + F1 score: good
            F1score = 2*(P*R)/(P+R)
