What is it?
    - example: cancer classification
        + 1% error on test set
        + only 0.5% of patients have cancer
            * y=0 all the time has 99.5% accuracy...
    - solution:
        + y=1 in presence of rare class
        + split errors in:
            ~ true positive
            ~ true negative
            ~ false positive
            ~ false negative
        + precision = #true_positives / (#true_positive + #false_positive)
            of all predicted cancer, what fraction really got cancer
        + recall = #true_positives / (#true_positive + #false_negative)
            of all the patient having cancer, what fraction actually got predicted
