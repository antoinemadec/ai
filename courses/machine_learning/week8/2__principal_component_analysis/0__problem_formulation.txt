Principle:
    - find lower dimension surface that minimizes |projections - original features|^2
    - reduce from n to k-dimension:
        find k vectors u(1), ..., u(k) minimizing the projection error

PCA is not linear regression:
    - linear reg:   ERROR = diff between line and X
    - PCA:          ERROR = diff between projection of X on the line and X
