what is unsupervised learning:
    - no label is given with the dataset
    - the goal is to create groups from those data
        + clustering algorithm
    - definition:
        Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no
        idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from
        data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

        We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on
        relationships among the variables in the data.

        With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction
        results.

examples:
    - organize computing clusters
    - social network analysis
    - market segmentation
    - astronomical data analysis
    - cocktail party problem:
        + microphone 1: person 1 louder than person 2
        + microphone 2: person 2 louder than person 1
        + goal: separate person 1 from person 2
