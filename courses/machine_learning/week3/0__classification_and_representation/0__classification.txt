Classification:
    - examples:
        + email: spam/not spam
        + online transactions: fraudulent/not fraudulent
    - y in {0,1}
    - multi-class classification: y in {0,1,...,k-1}

Algorithm:
    - first intuition: let's use linear regression with threshold
        + arbitrary threshold (0.5) does not work
        + y is 0 or 1, h(x) can be >1 or <0 !!!
        + it is not a great idea !!!
    - logistic regression:
        + 0 <= h(x) <= 1
