Neural Networks:
    - origins:
        + algorithms that try to mimic the brain
    - widely used in 80s and early 90s; diminished in late 90s
    - recent resurgence:
        + computer are now fast enough
        + state of the art technique

Why Mimicking the Brain:
    - too complex to create a huge algorithm to recognize images
    - hypothesis:
        + brain uses "one learning algorithm"
        + why not trying to find that algorithm instead?
