Neuron Networks:
    - we already use non-linear features with linear/logistic regression...:
        + e.g.:
            h(t)= g(t0 +t1*x1 + t2*x1*x2 + t3*x3^3...)
    -...so why do we need NN?:
        + using non-linear/quadratic features might increase the feature number too much
        + especially in computer vision
