Why not using supervised learning:
    - we have labels
    - so why not?...

Anomaly Detection:
    - very small number of positive examples (anomalies)
    - large number of negative example (normal)
    - many different "types" of anomalies:
        + hard for any algo to learn from positive examples
        + future anomalies may look nothing like any of the previous anomalous examples

Supervised Learning:
    - large number of positive and negative examples
    - future pos examples likely to be similar to ones in training set
