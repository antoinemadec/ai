Non-gaussian features:
    - make sure you features look gaussian
    - if not gaussian, try to transform your feature to a gaussian

Error analysis for anomaly detection:
    - most common problem:
        + p(x) is comparable for normal and anomalous example
        + solution: add features

Monitoring computers in a data center:
    - choose features that might take on large or small values when anomalous
        + x1 = mem use
        + x2 = disk accesses / sec
        + x3 = CPU load
        + x4 = network traffic
        + x5 = x3/x4
        + x6 = x3^2/x4
        etc
