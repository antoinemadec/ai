Online Learning:
    - shipping service website want to know if customer will use shipping service (y=1), or not (y=0)
    - features x capture properties of user, origin/dest and asking price
    - we want to learn p(y=1|x;theta)
        repeat forever {
            get (x,y) corresponding to user
            update theta using (x,y):
                tj := tj - alpha(h(x)-y)*xj
        }
        + no fixed training set
        + can adapt to chaing user preference

Other online learning example:
    - product search (learning to search)
        + user searches for "android phone 1080p camera"
        + have 100 phones in store, will return 10 results
        + context:
            x:  relevant features of phone and query
            y: (1) if user clicks on link; (0) otherwise
            learn p(y=1|x;theta)    (predicted CTR [click trough rate])
