context:
    - training set
    - hypothesis: h(x) = t0 + t1.x
    - t0 and t1 are parameters
    - goal:
        + h(x) close to y for training examples (x,y)
        + that is to say:
            cost function: J(t0,t1) = 1/2m * sum[h(x(i))-y(i)]2
            square error function
            minimize over(t0,t1) J(t0,t1)
