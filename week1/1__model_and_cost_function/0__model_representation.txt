example:
    Housing Prices:
        - price = f(square_feet)
        - suppervised learning
        - regression problem

notation:
    m:           nb of training examples
    x's:         "input" variable/features
    y's:         "output" variable/features
    (x,y):       one training example
    (x(i),y(i)): i-th training example

    x --> h --> predicted y

model for this example:
    linear regression with one variable:
        h(x) = a.x + b
