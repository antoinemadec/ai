Simplify function with one parameter:
    - repeat until convergence:
        t1 := t1 - alpha*dJ(t1)/dt1
    - if:
        derivative positive, decrease t1
        derivative negative, increase t1
    - alpha:
        + too small: can be slow
        + too big: can overshoot the minimum and fail to converge
        + with a fixed alpha:
            * steps (-alpha*dJ/dt1) will get smaller when closer to minimum,
            because abs(dJ/dt1) gets smaller
            * no need to have a variable alpha
