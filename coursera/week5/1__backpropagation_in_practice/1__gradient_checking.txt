Why:
    - what if your NN implementation is a bit buggy?
        + resulting in poor prediction
        + you might not even notice it
    - solution: use gradient checking

How:
    - compare:
        [J(THETA+epsilon)-J(THETA-epsilon)] / 2*epsilon
        dJ(THETA)/dTHETA
    - once this is checked, turn off for learning:
        computation intensive
