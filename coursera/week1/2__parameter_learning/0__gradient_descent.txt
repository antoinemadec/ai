What is it:
    - algo used in machine learning to minimize function
    - the goal will be to minimize the cost function:
        + have some func J(t0,t1), we want min(J(t0,t1)) over (t0,t1)
        + outline:
            1- start with some t0,t1
            2- keep changing t0,t1 to reduce J(t0,t1) until we hopefully end up
            at a minimum

Algorithm:
    repeat until convergence:
        tj := tj - alpha*dJ(t0,t1)/dtj      (for j in {0,1})
    correct simultaneous update:
        temp0 := t0 - alpha*d(J(t0,t1))/dt0
        temp1 := t1 - alpha*d(J(t0,t1))/dt1
        t0    := temp0
        t1    := temp1
    alpha:
        learning rate
        control the size of each step
