"It's not who has the best algo that wins. It's who has the most data."

Large data rationale:
    + useful test:
        given the input x, ca a human expert confidently predict y?
    + use a low bias algo + very large training set
        * a lot of parameters
        * unlikely to overfit
            ~ when Jtrai ~= Jtest => Jtest will be small
