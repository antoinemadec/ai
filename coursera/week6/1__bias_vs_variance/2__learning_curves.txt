Learning curves:
    - J = f(m)  # error = f(training example)
        + Jtrain increases
        + Jcv decreases
    - high bias:
        + Jtrain increases and flatten out
        + Jcv decreases and flatten out
        + both do not cross, asymptote
            more training data won't help
    - high variance:
        + Jtrain increases slowly
        + Jcv decreases slowly
        + large gap between Jtrain, Jcv
            more training data is likely to help
