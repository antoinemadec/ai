Debugging a learning algorithm:
    - what if error is huge on new set of houses:
        + get more training examples
            fixes high variance
        + try smaller sets of features
            fixes high variance
        + try getting additional features
            fixes high bias
        + try adding polynomial features
            fixes high bias
        + try decreasing lambda (regularization factor)
            fixes high bias
        + try increasing lambda (regularization factor)
            fixes high variance

Neural Networks and overfitting:
    - small NN:
        + computationally cheaper
        + fewer params
        + prone to underfitting
    - big NN:
        + computationally more expensive
        + more paramas
        + prone to overfitting
