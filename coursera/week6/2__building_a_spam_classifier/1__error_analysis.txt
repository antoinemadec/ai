Recommended approach:
    1- start with a simple algorithm; implement it and test it on your cross-validation data
    2- plot learning curves to decide if more data, more features etc
    3- error analysis manually examine the examples that your algo is making errors on (in the CV set).
        is there any systematic trend?

The importance of numerical evaluation
    - should discount/discounts/discounted etc be treated as the same word?
    - can use "stemming" software
    - error analysis might not tell you if this is useful or not:
        just try it and see for yourself
