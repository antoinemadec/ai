How:
    - use SVM software package (e.g.: liblinear, libsvm)
    - need to specify:
        + choice of parameter C
        + choice of kernel similarity function
            * no kernel ("linear kernel")
                y=1 if tT*x >= 0
            * gaussian kernel
                NOTE: do perform feature scaling before using the Gaussian kernel

Other choices of kernel:
    - has to satisfy technical condition called Mercer's theorem
    - polynomial kernels:
        k(x,l) = (xT*l)^2
        k(x,l) = (xT*l+1)^2
        k(x,l) = (xT*l+5)^4
        etc
    - more esoteric:
        string kernel
        chi-square kernel
        etc

Logistic regression vs SVMs:
    n = number of features
    m = number of training examples
    - if n is large relative to m:
        -> logistic regression
        -> or SVM without a kernel
    - if n is small, m is intermediate
        -> use SVM with Gaussian kernel
    - if n is small, m is large
        -> create/add more features, then use logistic regression or SVM without a kernel
    neural network likely to work well for most of these settings, but may be slower to train
