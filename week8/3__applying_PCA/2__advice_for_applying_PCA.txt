Supervised learning speedup:
    training set:
        (x(1),y(1)),...,(x(m),y(m))
    extract inputs:
        x(1),...,x(m)   in R10000
    apply PCA:
        z(1),...,z(m)   in R1000
    new training set:
        (z(1),y(1)),...,(z(m),y(m))

Note:
    - PCA computed on training set
    - x->z mapping can be applied on CV and test set

Bad use of PCA: To prevent overfitting:
    - false reasoning:
        + z(i) instead of x(i) to reduce the number of featyres to k<n
        + thus, fewer features, less likely to overfit
    - use regularization instead
