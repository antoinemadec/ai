Data preprocessing:
    - mean normalization:
        replace each xj(i) by:
            (xj(i) - mean_j) / (max_j - min_j)

PCA algorithm:
    compute covariance matrix:
        sigma = 1/m * sum( (x(i))*(x(i))T )
            = 1/m * XT*X
                where X = [x(1)T; ...; x(m)T]
        nxn matrix
    compute eigenvectors of matrix sigma:
        [U,S,V] = svd(Sigma)
        U is a nxn matrix
    to reduce from n- to k- dimensions:
        Ureduced = first k columns of U
        is nxk matrix
    projection is:
        z(i) = Ureduce T * x(i)
        k-dimensional vector
