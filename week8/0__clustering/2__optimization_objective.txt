Reminder:
    c(i)    = index of cluster to which example x(i) is currently assigned
    uk      = cluster centroid k (uk in Rn)
    uc(i)   = cluster centroid of cluster to which example x(i) has been assigned

Optimization Objective:
    - error or distortion:
        J(c(1), ... , c(m), u1, ... , uk) =
            1/m * sum( (x(i)-uc(i))^2 )
    - objective:
        minimize J(...) over c and u
            * cluster assignment:   minimize J(...) over c
            * move centroid:        minimize J(...) over u
