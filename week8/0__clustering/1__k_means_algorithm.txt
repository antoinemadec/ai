K-means algorithm:
    input:
        - K (number of clusters)
        - training set {x(1), x(2), ... , x(m)}
            with x(i) in Rn (no x0=1 convention)
    algo:
        randomly initialize K cluster centroids: u1, ... , uk in Rn
        repeat {
        # cluster assignment
            for i = 1 to m
                c(i) := index of closest centroid to x(i)
        # move centroid
            for k = a to K
                uk :- average of points assigned to cluster k
        }

K-means for non-separated clusters:
    - if not well separated
        + e.g.: T-shirt sizing
            * allow to create S,M,L out of continuous (size,weight) training set
